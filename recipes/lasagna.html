    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Meat: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground
      beef. Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with
      the meat to add tons of flavor. Tomato products: You'll need a can of
      crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
      Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the
      flavor of the sauce. Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is
      flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning,
      fennel seeds, and black pepper.

      Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
      Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna
      when you cut into it. Store bought noodles will be fine for lasanaga.
